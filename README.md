# Template-TFG
In this repository, you will find a set of files that compile to create the PDF document for your thesis at UAB (or adaptable to others). 

Inside the .tex document, you will find further explanations on how some commands should be used for them to work.

The .pdf file is just an example of what the output of your first compilation should be. The .jpg file is open source and can be found on the website of Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona.
